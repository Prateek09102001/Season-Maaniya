                            The summer season in India typically extends from March to June. During this time, the
                            weather
                            varies significantly across different regions, offering a diverse range of experiences for
                            travelers. While the plains and urban areas can get quite hot, with temperatures often
                            exceeding
                            40°C (104°F), other regions provide a pleasant escape from the heat.

                    <p>Agra is one of the most visited cities in India due to its abundance of historical sites. The Taj
                        Mahal, one of the world's most renowned structures, is, of course, at the top of this list of
                        Agra

                        With 51 beaches along its coastline, Goa is one of the most popular tourist destinations in
                        India.
                        Its white sand beaches, palm trees, low tax rate, wonderful coastal food, and laid-back
                        demeanour
                        make it a fantastic tourist destination in India.

                        Winter is the greatest season to visit this location because the weather is ideal (though this
                        is
                        when it can get expensive, too). In addition to the beach, the city's nightlife is not to be
                        missed.
